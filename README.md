Whee - see you there
===============

"*Find a friend to hang out with. Right from your phone.*"

**Whee** is a a social app for quickly setting up events and do stuff with current or future friends. Whether it's going out for lunch in 15 minutes or for a movie next Saturday, Whee is the place to find out what's happening.

Wih **Whee** you can quickly setup a new event that other users will be notified about immediately and can join you in. You can subscribe to event categories to your own choice and see what's hot right now; tags for events that are about to happen soon will bubble to the top in the "What's Hot?" section so when lunch is approaching then those events will be easy to spot.
